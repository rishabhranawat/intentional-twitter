Title: Topological Density Correlations in a Fermi Gas
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('Pok Man Tam'), arxiv.Result.Author('Charles L. Kane')]
Summary: A Fermi gas of non-interacting electrons, or ultra-cold fermionic atoms, has
a quantum ground state defined by a region of occupancy in momentum space known
as the Fermi sea. The Euler characteristic $\chi_F$ of the Fermi sea serves to
topologically classify these gapless fermionic states. The topology of a $D$
dimensional Fermi sea is physically encoded in the $D+1$ point equal time
density correlation function. In this work, we first present a simple proof of
this fact by showing that the evaluation of the correlation function can be
formulated in terms of a triangulation of the Fermi sea with a collection of
points, links and triangles and their higher dimensional analogs. We then make
use of the topological $D+1$ point density correlation to reveal universal
structures of the more general $M$ point density correlation functions in a $D$
dimensional Fermi gas. Two experimental methods are proposed for observing
these correlations in $D=2$. In cold atomic gases imaged by quantum gas
microscopy, our analysis supports the feasibility of measuring the third order
density correlation, from which $\chi_F$ can be reliably extracted in systems
with as few as around 100 atoms. For solid-state electron gases, we propose
measuring correlations in the speckle pattern of intensity fluctuations in
nonlinear X-ray scattering experiments.

Title: An Uncertainty Principle for the Curvelet Transform, and the Infeasibility of Quantum Algorithms for Finding Short Lattice Vectors
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('Yi-Kai Liu')]
Summary: The curvelet transform is a special type of wavelet transform, which is
useful for estimating the locations and orientations of waves propagating in
Euclidean space. We prove an uncertainty principle that lower-bounds the
variance of these estimates, for radial wave functions in n dimensions.
  As an application of this uncertainty principle, we show the infeasibility of
one approach to constructing quantum algorithms for solving lattice problems,
such as the approximate shortest vector problem (approximate-SVP), and bounded
distance decoding (BDD). This gives insight into the computational
intractability of approximate-SVP, which plays an important role in algorithms
for integer programming, and in post-quantum cryptosystems.
  In this approach to solving lattice problems, one prepares quantum
superpositions of Gaussian-like wave functions centered at lattice points. A
key step in this procedure requires finding the center of each Gaussian-like
wave function, using the quantum curvelet transform. We show that, for any
choice of the Gaussian-like wave function, the error in this step will be above
the threshold required to solve BDD and approximate-SVP.

Title: Characterizing and Mitigating Timing Noise-Induced Decoherence in Single Electron Sources
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('Sungguen Ryu'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rosa López'), arxiv.Result.Author('Llorenç Serra'), arxiv.Result.Author('David Sanchez'), arxiv.Result.Author('Michael Moskalets')]
Summary: Identifying and controlling decoherence in single electron sources (SES) is
important for their applications in electron quantum optics and quantum
information processing. Here we address a rather generic source of decoherence
inherent to SES generating pico-second wave packets as in a recent experiment
[J. D. Fletcher et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 5298 (2019)], namely, decoherence
caused by timing noise in the source. Regardless of the specific microscopic
mechanism, the source with timing noise generates an ensemble of temporally
shifted wave packet instead of a single wave packet, and the density matrix in
energy basis becomes squeezed along the diagonal. This distinctive feature
allows us to propose a protocol to identify and characterize SES with timing
noise. Using this protocol, we demonstrate that the purity of states decohered
by timing noise can be readily enhanced by using an energy filtering via
potential barriers.

Title: Echoes from bounded universes

Summary: We construct a general class of modified Ellis wormholes, where one
asymptotic Minkowski region is replaced by a bounded 2-sphere core,
characterized by asymptotic finite areal radius. We pursue an in-depth analysis
of the resulting geometry, outlining that geodesic completeness is guaranteed
also when the radial function asymptotically shrinks to zero. Then, we study
the evolution of scalar perturbations, bringing out how these geometric
configurations can in principle affect the time-domain profiles of quasinormal
modes, pointing out the distinctive features with respect to other black holes
or wormholes geometries.

Title: Comparative study of light storage in antirelaxation-coated and buffer-gas-filled alkali vapor cells
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('Marin Ðujić'), arxiv.Result.Author('D. Buhin'), arxiv.Result.Author('N. Šantić'), arxiv.Result.Author('D. Aumiler'), arxiv.Result.Author('T. Ban')]
Summary: We perform a comparative study of light storage in antirelaxation-coated and
buffer-gas-filled alkali-vapor cells using electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in warm rubidium vapor. The use of a buffer-gas-filled cell
resulted in $\approx$10-fold improvement in storage time and efficiency
compared to antirelaxation coated cells. Our findings contribute to the
development of future field-deployable high-performance quantum memories.

Title: Atom interferometers in weakly curved spacetimes using Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations

Summary: We present a systematic approach to determine all relativistic phases up to
$\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$ in light-pulse atom interferometers in weakly curved
spacetime that are based on elastic scattering, namely Bragg diffraction and
Bloch oscillations. Our analysis is derived from first principles using the
parameterized post-Newtonian formalism. In the treatment developed here, we
derive algebraic expressions for relativistic phases for arbitrary
interferometer geometries in an automated manner. As case studies, we consider
symmetric and antisymmetric Ramsey-Bord\'e interferometers, as well as a
symmetric double diffraction interferometer with baseline lengths of 10 m and
100 m. We compare our results to previous calculations conducted for a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

Title: Spinning a levitated mechanical oscillator far into the deep-strong coupling regime

Summary: The field of levitodynamics has made substantial advancements in manipulating
the translational and rotational degrees of freedom of levitated nanoparticles.
Notably, rotational degrees of freedom can now be cooled to millikelvin
temperatures and driven into GHz rotational speeds. However, in the case of
cylindrically symmetric nanorotors, only the rotations around their short axes
have been effectively manipulated, while the possibility to control rotation
around the longer axis has remained a notable gap in the field. Here, we extend
the rotational control toolbox by engineering an optically levitated
nanodumbbell in vacuum into controlled spinning around its long axis with
spinning rates exceeding 1 GHz. This fast spinning introduces deep-strong
coupling between the nanodumbell's libration modes, such that the coupling rate
$g$ exceeds the bare libration frequencies $\Omega_0$ by two orders of
magnitude with $g/\Omega_0=724\pm 33$. Our control over the long-axis rotation
opens the door to study the physics of deep-strong coupled mechanical
oscillators and to observe macroscopic rotational quantum interference effects,
thus laying a solid foundation for future applications in quantum technologies.
Additionally, we find that our system offers great potential as a nanoscopic
gyroscope with competitive sensitivity.

Title: Adaptive variational ground state preparation for spin-1 models on qubit-based architectures
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('João C. Getelina'), arxiv.Result.Author('Cai-Zhuang Wang'), arxiv.Result.Author('Thomas Iadecola'), arxiv.Result.Author('Yong-Xin Yao'), arxiv.Result.Author('Peter P. Orth')]
Summary: We apply the adaptive variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE)
method to prepare ground states of one-dimensional spin $S=1$ models. We
compare different spin-to-qubit encodings (standard binary, Gray, unary, and
multiplet) with regard to the performance and quantum resource cost of the
algorithm. Using statevector simulations we study two well-known spin-1 models:
the Blume-Capel model of transverse-field Ising spins with single-ion
anisotropy, and the XXZ model with single-ion anisotropy. We consider system
sizes of up to $20$ qubits, which corresponds to spin-$1$ chains up to length
$10$. We determine the dependence of the number of CNOT gates in the AVQITE
state preparation circuit on the encoding, the initial state, and the choice of
operator pool in the adaptive method. Independent on the choice of encoding, we
find that the CNOT gate count scales cubically with the number of spins for the
Blume-Capel model and quartically for the anistropic XXZ model. However, the
multiplet and Gray encodings present smaller prefactors in the scaling
relations. These results provide useful insights for the implementation of
AVQITE on quantum hardware.

Title: Non-minimally coupled quintessence in the Gauss-Bonnet model, symmetry breaking, and cosmic acceleration
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('H. Mohseni Sadjadi')]
Summary: We consider a model consisting of a quintessence coupled to the Ricci scalar
and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. We propose a mechanism for the rising of dark
energy in the matter era, alleviating the coincidence problem. The role of the
Gauss-Bonnet invariant is to restore the initial $Z_2$ symmetry. The Ricci
scalar breaks this symmetry during the Universe's expansion and activates the
quintessence. In our model, the observational constraint on gravitational wave
speed is respected.

Title: Quantifying High-Order Interdependencies in Entangled Quantum States
Authors: [arxiv.Result.Author('Marco Alberto Javarone'), arxiv.Result.Author('Fernando E. Rosas'), arxiv.Result.Author('Paolo Facchi'), arxiv.Result.Author('Saverio Pascazio'), arxiv.Result.Author('Sebastiano Stramaglia')]
Summary: Here, we leverage recent advances in information theory to develop a novel
method to characterise the dominant character of the high-order dependencies of
quantum systems. To this end, we introduce the Q-information: an
information-theoretic measure capable of distinguishing quantum states
dominated by synergy or redundancy. We illustrate the measure by investigating
the properties of paradigmatic entangled Qubit states and find that -- in
contrast to classical systems -- quantum systems need at least four variables
to exhibit high-order properties. Furthermore, our results reveal that unitary
evolution can radically affect the internal information organisation in a way
that strongly depends on the corresponding Hamiltonian. Overall, the
Q-information sheds light on novel aspects of the internal organisation of
quantum systems and their time evolution, opening new avenues for studying
several quantum phenomena and related technologies.
